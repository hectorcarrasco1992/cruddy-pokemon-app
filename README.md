# Purpose
    Finding pokemon icons for the original pokemon are extremely hard to find with out using an API or paying to download them in bulk. I set out to make an easier way to get them. A loophole as some may call it.

# How to Use

* Simply write the name of the pokemon you want in the search bar
* Right click on the image and save it to your computer
* Click the catch button to keep track of the ones you already have.
* Thats It!

# A work in progress
    This is just the beginning. More pokemon will be added, but adding every single image of over 800 pokemon quite process.

### Enjoy!!
